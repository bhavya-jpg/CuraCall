Here’s how we can adapt the project process document into an incremental “phase-by-phase” execution workflow so that you can build ➡️ test ➡️ validate ➡️ move on.

Incremental Development & Testing Plan
Phase 0 — Setup & Planning
Goal: Have environment, accounts, and architecture ready.

Set up Git repo for version control.

Create environment variable file (.env) templates for:

MongoDB credentials

Twilio account SID/auth token

Google Calendar OAuth credentials

OpenAI API key

Create accounts:

MongoDB Atlas (unless you want local Mongo)

Twilio (Voice & WhatsApp enabled)

Google Cloud Console project for Calendar API

Install dev tools: Node.js (latest LTS), npm/yarn, ngrok.

Test Cases for Phase 0:

Can commit/push code to GitHub without secrets leaking.

.env values load properly in backend.

Phase 1 — Base Prescripto MERN App
Goal: App works just like in the tutorial with standard booking flows.

Tasks:

Follow the YouTube Prescripto tutorial completely.

Test:

Patient signup/login

Doctor signup/login

Admin dashboard access

Web-based booking & payment flow

Test Cases for Phase 1:

Booking created in Mongo (check DB directly).

Doctor dashboard shows bookings.

Admin can see all bookings.

Payment flow works in test mode.

Phase 2 — Google Calendar Integration
Goal: Doctors can link their Google Calendar and bookings are tracked on it.

Tasks:

Add “Connect Google Calendar” button in Doctor Dashboard.

Implement OAuth flow and store refresh tokens.

Implement backend API:

check-availability

book (calendar + Mongo)

Modify web booking API to also create a Google Calendar event.

Test Cases for Phase 2:

Doctor can connect Google account and select a calendar.

Web booking creates Google Calendar event.

API blocks double booking if slot is occupied.

Once this works, you know your availability check logic is sound before adding the voice assistant.

Phase 3 — Voice Assistant (Inbound Calls)
Goal: Caller can talk to AI assistant and book an appointment.

Tasks:

Set up Twilio number with webhook.

Implement Twilio Media Streams → OpenAI Realtime bridge.

Define tool calls:

find_doctors_by_specialty_and_area

check_doctor_availability

book_appointment

send_whatsapp_confirmation

Train assistant’s prompt with booking conversation flow.

Test Cases for Phase 3:

Call Twilio number → AI greets & asks specialty.

AI reads doctor names from DB.

AI checks Google Calendar before booking.

Successful booking in Mongo + Calendar.

Phase 4 — WhatsApp Confirmation
Goal: After booking (web or voice), user gets appointment details on WhatsApp.

Tasks:

Enable Twilio WhatsApp sandbox or Live API.

Implement WhatsApp message trigger after booking confirmation.

Format message with:

Doctor name/specialty

Appointment date/time

Location/Google Maps link

Test Cases for Phase 4:

Booking from web sends WhatsApp message.

Booking from voice sends WhatsApp message.

Phase 5 — Outbound Calls (Optional)
Goal: Website triggers an AI-driven outbound booking confirmation call.

Tasks:

Button on doctor page: “Confirm via Voice Call”.

Backend triggers Twilio outgoing call API to number.

AI completes same booking flow.

Test Cases for Phase 5:

Starting from website triggers outgoing call.

AI handles date/time conflicts as in inbound flow.

Phase 6 — Admin Tools, Logs, Error Handling
Goal: Track voice bookings, transcripts, errors.

Tasks:

Add booking channel field ("web" or "voice").

Admin dashboard shows voice bookings separately.

Store short call transcript for audits.

Test Cases for Phase 6:

Voice bookings visible with tag.

Errors from AI/Twilio are logged.

Workflow Advice
After each phase, commit and push to GitHub. Tag release:
Example: v1.0-phase1-complete

Run post-phase testing with real API credentials.

Keep mock/stub data for API calls when possible (especially Calendar API) for local testing.
